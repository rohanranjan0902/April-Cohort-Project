Problem 3 - Reverie Language Technologies

Call Center Analytics Platform
Build an application for call center analytics which includes features such as call transcription, speaker
identification (Agent vs Customer), Sentiment analysis, Hold Time, Dead Air, Agent Overtalk etc.
Any open source models or public APIs can be used to build this solution.
The solution is needed to be created for English and Hindi Language conversations but should be
extendable to other Indian languages.
